 # Malafy's Meat Processing LLC Order Assistant Application
 ------------------------------------------------------------------
This application is desgined to aid a customer of Malafys Meat Processing by providing a simple and easy way to order meat. The project idea was given to me by a fellow professor who wanted an easier way of ordering the large quantities of meat he had. Handling large quanuties of meat makes it a tedious process by hand. Thats where the Malafy's Meat Order Assistant helps out. This assistant is designed to tackle issues like these and make it easy on the user order, rather than making them do all of the hard work.
 
 > Malafys Meat Processing has has a complex way for customers to order meat. The interactive web application was geared toward simplifying the ordering process. This web app was built from stratch using Python Flask and HTML. It utilizies multiple different modules to complete the many tasks within the application.
 
 >The web application completes task such as calculating the total price, price per item, number of pounds ordered, and supply an easy to understand summary of your order. 
 
 >Please Note: This web application will be worked upon over the next couple of months to organize, add features, clean up and simplify the code. This project was created to be a educational experience for me, but to help fellow freinds and family who may find this of use.
